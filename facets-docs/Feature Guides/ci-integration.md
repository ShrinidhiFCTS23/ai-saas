# Integrating with Jenkins

## :one: Set Global Environment Variable

Navigate to ‚ÄúManage Jenkins -> Configure System -> Global properties option‚Äù. Check the ‚ÄúEnvironment variables‚Äù checkbox and then add the following variables

1. $CP_URL - Your Control Plane URL.  
2. $CC_TOKEN - Your Authentication token.
3. $CC_USER - Authorized username in your Control Plane

## :two: Create or edit your Job

Go about the regular Jenkins build process.
