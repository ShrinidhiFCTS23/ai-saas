## IaC in Facets

Infrastructure as Code (IaC) is the managing and provisioning of infrastructure through your Control Plane instead of through manual processes.

Facets provides these three different streams of IaC in your Control Plane for consistent, error free deployments:

- Production
- Staging
- Development

### Use Cases

By using IaC versions, users can get the following advantages over traditional manual deployments:

- Fixed version for your IaC  
  Maintaining consistency across environments is as simple as deploying with a fixed IaC version and provides the additional benefit of having immutable infrastructure.
- Staging IaC as a precursor for upcoming changes  
  Users can test their environments reliably in the Staging IaC, to ensure zero down-time when they deploy resources in Production IaC.
- Major version upgrade  
  Users can update their environments in a safe manner by testing and deploying resources using a major version of IaC in the staging stream, then migrating the neccessary environments to the next major version.

## Prerequisites to manage IaC versions

- An environment with resources must exist in the blueprint where your infrastructure has been added in the definition. 

> ðŸ“˜ NOTE
> 
> If there is no defined IaC version for an environment during deployment, Facets will automatically select the latest version of IaC from `PRODUCTION` stream.

## Manage IaC Version from your Control Plane

Facets allows you to manage the IaC version from your **Environment Overview** screen as well as **Releases** screen. 

> ðŸ“˜ NOTE
> 
> IaC version or stream change will take effect from the next release after the change.
