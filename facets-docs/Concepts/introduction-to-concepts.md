Here is a list of the key concepts in Facets, each with a link to a more detailed explanation:

- [Facets Control Plane](doc:control-plane): This is the underlying infrastructure that powers Facets and provides the centralized management and control of your resources.
- [Blueprints](doc:blueprint): Blueprints are a way to define your cloud infrastructure as code, making it easy to manage and deploy your resources.
- [Environments](doc:environment): Environments are used to create and manage instances of your blueprints, allowing you to run multiple versions of your infrastructure in parallel.
- [CI Integration](doc:artifacts): CI integration is a way to manage and store Docker images for your services, making it easy to deploy your services to different environments.
- [Releases](doc:releases-concept): Releases are a way to deploy changes to your environments, making it easy to keep your systems up-to-date and stable.
- [Resource JSON](doc:resource-json): All resources are described using a JSON file that follows a specific schema in Facets. 
- [IaC in Facets](doc:iac-using-facets): Facets Control Plane uses Infrastructure as Code (IaC) to enable teams to manage and automate infrastructure deployments seamlessly.
