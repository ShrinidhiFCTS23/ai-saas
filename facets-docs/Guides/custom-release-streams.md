Facets allows users to add multiple custom release streams alongside the predefined ones.

> ðŸ“˜ 
> 
> **Note: **While all users can view the list of release streams, creating and deleting release streams requires the `RELEASE_STREAM_WRITE` and `RELEASE_STREAM_DELETE` permissions, respectively.

1. Navigate to **Artifacts > Promotion Workflow.**
2. Switch to the **Release Streams **tab.  
   Here, you will be able to view a list of release streams available in Facets.
3. Click **Add Release Stream.**
4. In the pop-up that appears:
   1. Mention the **Release Stream Name** and **Description.**
   2. Now, enable the toggle to set this as a **Production Release Stream.**

> ðŸ“˜ 
> 
> **Note:** Enabling **Production Release Stream** allows you to halt all scheduled releases using the Facets bot in the event of an issue.

5. Click **Create.**
