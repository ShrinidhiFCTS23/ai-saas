## API Endpoint

This API processes a <code>POST</code> request to override current configuration for resources across an environment.

```text Hover on the Text and Click the Notepad icon to Copy
https://{YOUR_CP_URL}/cc-ui/v1/clusters/{clusterId}/resourceType/{resourceType}/resourceName/{resourceName}/overrides
```

- This API endpoint has four **path parameters**: `YOUR_CP_URL`, `clusterId`, `resourceType`, and `resourceName`.
- There is also a **body parameter**, `overrides`.

### **Path parameters**

- `YOUR_CP_URL `of type `String`.  
  This is the Control Plane URL specific to your account.
- `clusterId `of type `String`.

### **Body parameters**

`overrides` is an object that will take `key:value` pairs of type `String`.

> üìò
