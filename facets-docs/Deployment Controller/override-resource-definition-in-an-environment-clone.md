API Endpoint
------------

This API processes a <code>POST</code> request to override current configuration for resources across an environment.

[block:code]
{
  "codes": [
    {
      "code": "https://{YOUR_CP_URL}/cc-ui/v1/clusters/{clusterId}/resourceType/{resourceType}/resourceName/{resourceName}/overrides",
      "language": "Hover on the Text and Click on Notepad icon to Copy"
    }
  ]
}
[/block]

- This API endpoint has four **[path parameters](https://readme.facets.cloud/reference/override-a-resource-in-an-environment#path-parameters)**: `YOUR_CP_URL`, `clusterId`, `resourceType`, and `resourceName`.
- There is also a **[body parameter](https://readme.facets.cloud/reference/override-a-resource-in-an-environment#body-parameters)**, `overrides`.

### **Path parameters**

- `YOUR_CP_URL `of type `String`.  
  This is the Control Plane URL specific to your account.
- `clusterId `of type `String`.  
  This is the unique ID for the environment where you want to override values in a defined resource. You can find this ID in the Environment Overview screen in Facets UI.
- `resourceType`of type `String`.  
  This is the type of resource you want to override.
- `resourceName`of type `String`.  
  This is the name of the resource you want to override. 

> ‚ö†Ô∏è Validate your API request
> 
> Ensure that the blueprint contains a defined `resourceName.json` file for the resource in the path `resourceType/instances/resourceName` where you want to override values.

### **Body parameters**

`overrides` is an object that will take `key:value` pairs of type `String`.

> üìò NOTE:
> 
> - The data in the `overrides `object will be merged with the existing definition in the `resourceName.json` file defined in the blueprint.
> - Ensure that the`key:value` pairs match the keys and values in the `resourceName.json` file defined in the blueprint.

```json overrides
{
"overrides": {
   "key1": "value1",
   "key2": "value2"
}
}
```
```json Example of overrides
# To override the values for cpuThreshold to 60 
# In https://github.com/Facets-cloud/sample-springboot-app-stack/blob/master/application/instances/backend.json

{
"overrides": {
   "cpuThreshold": "60"
}
}
```
