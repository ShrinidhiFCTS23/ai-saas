## API Endpoint

Any versioned resources will have a  `versioningKey` that is uniquely associated with that resource.

This API processes a `GET` request to fetch the details for a given environment, resource type and resource name. 

```text Hover on the Text and Click the Notepad icon to Copy
https://{YOUR_CP_URL}/cc-ui/v1/artifacts/cluster/{clusterId}/resourceType/{resourceType}/resourceName/{resourceName}
```

- This API endpoint has three **path parameters**, `clusterID`, `resourceType` and `resourceName`.

### **Path parameters**

- `clusterId` of type `String` is the unique ID for the environment where you want to perform a rollback. You can find this ID in the Environment Overview screen in Facets UI.
- `resourceType` of type `String` is the defined type of resource. This should be the same as it is defined in your blueprint.
- `resourceName` of type `String` is the name of the resource.
