The primary use case for selectively enabling or disabling an application in an environment is to either add or remove that particular application in the next release. This is achieved by overriding the Container Configuration for an application from its Configuration Screen.

## Prerequisites

An application should be defined in the blueprint specification in the environment where you want to override its current configuration.

## Disable an Application from your Control Plane

1. Login to Facets Control Plane. 
2. Select the **Blueprint **which has your **Environment**.

    }
  ]
}

3. Navigate to **Applications **page from the sidebar and click on the Application in question.

5. Choose whether you want to disable this application from being included in the next release by ticking the **Disabled **checkbox, and clicking on the **Submit **button at the bottom of the screen.

    }
  ]
}
[/block]

6. You will see a popup window asking you to **Review Changes**. Click on **Submit Changes** to override the configuration.

The change of state of an application as toggled by a user will only be enforced on the next release of the environment.
