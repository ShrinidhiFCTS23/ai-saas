Facets provides the capability to override the configuration for any resources in an environment from the Control Plane.

## Prerequisites

- The environment you are using should have at least one defined resource in it to be able to override it. 

## Override a resource from the Control Plane

> ðŸ“˜ 
> 
> For a given blueprint and environment, you can find all the defined resources under the Resources tab in the sidebar.

1. Login to Facets Control Plane. 
2. Select the Environment in your defined Blueprint.

    {
      "image": [
        "https://files.readme.io/e847578-env_page.png",
        null,
        "Select the environment (Click on the image to expand)"
      ],
      "align": "center",
      "sizing": "450px",
      "border": true,
      "caption": "Select the environment (Click on the image to expand)"
    }
  ]
}
[/block]

3. Navigate to the Resources tab from the sidebar and select the resource that you want to override.

  "images": [
    {
      "image": [
        "https://files.readme.io/981f29d-appingress.png",
        null,
        "Select the Resource (Click on the image to expand)"
      ],
      "align": "center",
      "sizing": "450px",
      "border": true,
      "caption": "Select the Resource (Click on the image to expand)"
    }
  ]
}
[/block]

4. You will now be able to view the Configuration screen where you can find currently defined values for that resource.

> ðŸ“˜ NOTE
> 
> All defined resources except for type `application `will directly open the **Configuration** screen for that resource.
> 
> Resources that are of type `application `will direct the user to the **Live Release** tab. The **Configuration** tab can be accessed next to the Live Release tab. 
> 
> See [Override resources of type `application `](https://readme.facets.cloud/docs/overriding-resources-in-a-cluster#override-resources-of-type-application)for more information.

5. Click on the Override button, this will open a new page.

### Override resources of type `application `

> ðŸ“˜ 
> 
> The override screen for resources that are of type `application` has two modes:
> 
> - **Form Mode**
> - **JSON Mode**

You can override defined parameters for **Container Configuration** and **User-defined Variables** in **Form Mode**. 

[block:image]
{
  "images": [
    {
      "image": [
        "https://files.readme.io/955960a-override_backend.png",
        null,
        "Override `application` (Click on the image to expand)"
      ],
      "align": "center",
      "sizing": "450px",
      "border": true,
      "caption": "Override `application` (Click on the image to expand)"
    }
  ]
}
[/block]

You can also toggle to **JSON Mode** to get an override page matching all the other resources where you can input values from your keyboard. 

[block:image]
{
  "images": [
    {
      "image": [
        "https://files.readme.io/259c897-json_mode.png",
        null,
        "Toggle JSON Mode (Click on the image to expand)"
      ],
      "align": "center",
      "sizing": "450px",
      "border": true,
      "caption": "Toggle JSON Mode (Click on the image to expand)"
    }
  ]
}
[/block]

## Constraints

The overridden configuration as changed by a user will only be enforced on the next release of the environment.
